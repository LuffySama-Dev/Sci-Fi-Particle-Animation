Hey there !! How you doing? 

As we are all stuck in our homes some us are developing diffrent hobbies. So, I have also developed a new hobby for myself. I have started to learn blender. It's an freeware use for building animation models and much more. So, I did my first project in blender of creating a sci-fi particle dispersion using blender. I am attaching the project file as well as the video. 

Thank you
