Hey there !! How are you doing?

As we are all stuck in our homes some of us are developing different hobbies. So, I have also developed a new hobby for myself. I have started to learn blender. It's a freeware used for building animation models and much more. So, I did my first project in a blender of creating a sci-fi particle dispersion using a blender. Actually the file is too big to be uploaded do I am just adding some Screenshots.

Thank you
